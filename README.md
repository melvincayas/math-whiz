# Math Whizard

This is a project I started while I was learning JavaScript. It's a math game using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS! Feel free to check it out [here](https://www.mathwhizard.com).

## Game Settings

There are multiple settings the user can choose to customize the game.

### Difficulty

- **Easy** - two single-digit numbers
- **Medium** - one double-digit number and one single-digit number
- **Hard** - two double-digit numbers

### Operators

The user can pick which operators to use:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

### Game Style

- **Unlimited** - Neverending equations
- **60 Second Fury** - 60 second timer to add the pressure

### Use of Negative Numbers

The user can choose whether equations will include negative numbers.

## Future of Math Whizard

I started this project in March 2021 while taking a [full-stack web developer course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy. My goal was to see what I could do with JavaScript.

I revisited this project in June 2021 and I -

- Refactored the code
- Added error handling for empty inputs
- Modified the game layout
- Included the use of negative numbers
- Added sound, hover, and color effects for playfulness

If I were to expand on Math Whizard, I'd create a user database and let users keep track of their scores and compare with friends.

## Installation
